## 🎮 Gameplay
You are the **Search Foundry** agent (the Clone), floating in the digital void.
Your mission: **Pop the AI Bubble**.

- **The Bubble**: A finite set of unique AI models (displaying **Model Name** & **Company**) spawn in waves.
- **Spawn Timer**: A visual timer bar indicates when the next wave of AI models will arrive.
- **Potential (TTL)**: Each model has a "Potential" score that decreases over time (1000 points/sec).
- **Bubble Burst**: If a model's potential reaches zero, it self-destructs (the bubble bursts), and you lose those points.
- **Scoring**: Click on enemies to destroy them and "capture" their remaining potential as your score.
- **Win Condition**: Destroy all models to clear the arena and see your total score and time.
- **Physics**: Realistic bouncing, zero-gravity mechanics, and a **Central Obstacle** that deflects objects.

## 🕹️ Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the Clone (Agent)
- **Mouse Click**: Destroy Enemy
- **Volume Slider**: Adjust Music Volume
